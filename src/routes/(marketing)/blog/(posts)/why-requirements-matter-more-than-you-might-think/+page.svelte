<p class="lead">Framing the problem is key</p>

<p>
  Software engineers and industry are always into raising productivity from
  using more efficient tools. But have you ever noticed super agile teams with
  good DORA metrics not achieving their goals?
</p>

<h3>Framing the problem is key</h3>

<p>
  Effiency is all about spending less resources for the task, but why are
  engineers not talking about effectiveness? Sure building what users need and
  what solves problems is paramount, regardless of the development effort it
  takes. So let's just dive into framing what really matters and focus on
  building just that, nothing more.

<h3>
  Task management issues moved to done don't matter, shipped functionality does!
</h3>

<p>
  Have you ever noticed some teams move so many cards to done column yet no one
  knows when is the shining new feature going live? That's because task
  management are usually poorly related to meaningful work. Jira issues don't
  matter. Implemented requirements do!
</p>

<h3>We're here to help</h3>

<p>
  We're trying to help engineers own digital products again, by better defining
  and implementing functionalities and features that matter. This is all about
  properly stating what is to be build, what are the acceptance criteria to be
  met, and what are the success criteria to make that bet effort worth it
</p>

<h3>Single source of truth without diving into source code</h3>

<p>
  Automaticaly keep track of what is to be done, what is being built as we speak
  and what is live. If you're a lead and need to communicate with assurance to
  your customers, stakeholders and peers your state of the art, stop wasting
  time and get your anwsers straightforward with confidence and assurance.
