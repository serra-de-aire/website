<p class="lead">Recapping scope and requirements related principles</p>

<h3>Two of the meaningful principles behind the Agile Manifesto:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
    <br />
    Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
  </p>
